```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r}
catch_df <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1", method = "libcurl"),
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(catch_df)
```

Data are in wide format. All and notes columns could be problematic. 

```{r}
unique(catch_df$notesRegCode)
```

This information should really be in metadata; won't be used for analysis. 

```{r}
catch_df %>% 
  select(Region, Year, Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, Pink, Chum) %>% 
  head()
```

This isn't saved to a new object yet. Just checking to make sure that this is what we want. 

```{r}
catch_df <- catch_df %>% 
  select(Region, Year, Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, Pink, Chum)
  head(catch_df)
```

Selecting columns by name is more powerful; accounts for changes to DF that may change row/column numbers.
